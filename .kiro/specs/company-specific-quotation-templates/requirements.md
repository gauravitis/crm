# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Currently, all three companies in the CRM system (Chembio Lifesciences, Chembio Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd., and Chemlab Synthesis) generate quotations with essentially the same Word document format, differing only in header colors. This creates a lack of brand differentiation and doesn't reflect each company's unique identity and business focus. The system needs to generate truly distinct quotation formats that align with each company's branding, target market, and business requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want each company to have a distinctly different quotation format, so that our documents reflect the unique brand identity and professionalism of each company.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quotation is generated for Chembio Lifesciences THEN the system SHALL use a modern, clean template with blue branding and scientific layout
2. WHEN a quotation is generated for Chembio Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd. THEN the system SHALL use a formal, corporate template with dark blue/gold branding and traditional business layout
3. WHEN a quotation is generated for Chemlab Synthesis THEN the system SHALL use a technical, research-focused template with green branding and laboratory-style layout
4. WHEN any quotation is generated THEN the system SHALL include company-specific header designs, logos, and contact information formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want each company's quotation to have different structural layouts and information presentation, so that they cater to their specific target markets and business types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a Chembio Lifesciences quotation THEN the system SHALL use a modern grid layout with emphasis on product specifications and lead times
2. WHEN generating a Chembio Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd. quotation THEN the system SHALL use a traditional formal business layout with emphasis on terms, conditions, and corporate compliance
3. WHEN generating a Chemlab Synthesis quotation THEN the system SHALL use a technical layout with emphasis on chemical specifications, CAS numbers, and research details
4. WHEN any quotation is generated THEN the system SHALL position elements (client details, items table, terms) differently based on the company template

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client receiving quotations, I want to immediately recognize which company sent the quotation based on its visual design and layout, so that I can easily distinguish between different suppliers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a Chembio Lifesciences quotation THEN the client SHALL see a modern, approachable design with rounded elements and contemporary typography
2. WHEN viewing a Chembio Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd. quotation THEN the client SHALL see a formal, corporate design with sharp lines and traditional business formatting
3. WHEN viewing a Chemlab Synthesis quotation THEN the client SHALL see a technical, scientific design with data-focused presentation and research-oriented styling
4. WHEN comparing quotations from different companies THEN the client SHALL be able to immediately distinguish them by visual design alone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each company template to have configurable branding elements, so that we can maintain consistent brand identity across all generated documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company template is applied THEN the system SHALL use company-specific colors, fonts, and spacing defined in the company configuration
2. WHEN a company has custom branding settings THEN the system SHALL apply logo placement, header styling, and color schemes automatically
3. WHEN company branding is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in all newly generated quotations without code modifications
4. WHEN no custom branding is defined THEN the system SHALL fall back to template-specific default styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sales manager, I want different information emphasis and presentation for each company type, so that quotations highlight the most relevant details for each business model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating quotations for Chembio Lifesciences THEN the system SHALL emphasize product availability, lead times, and modern presentation
2. WHEN generating quotations for Chembio Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd. THEN the system SHALL emphasize compliance information, formal terms, and corporate credibility
3. WHEN generating quotations for Chemlab Synthesis THEN the system SHALL emphasize technical specifications, research applications, and scientific accuracy
4. WHEN any quotation includes items THEN the system SHALL present item details in a format appropriate to the company's business focus

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable template system that allows easy customization and extension, so that new companies or template modifications can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new company THEN the system SHALL allow creation of custom templates without modifying existing template code
2. WHEN modifying a template THEN the system SHALL isolate changes to specific company templates without affecting others
3. WHEN template logic is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing quotation data
4. WHEN debugging template issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback mechanisms
